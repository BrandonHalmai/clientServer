What is this?
</b></p3>
<br>
<br>
<p3>
This is a client application built in Python in order to connect to an active server. You'll be able to send data in the form of characters to the server and see if the transmission was successful.

How do I use it
</b></p3>
<br>
<br>
<p3>
First you must connect to the server by entering in the IP address into the field. If successful, the application will respond with a successful response. If this is not the case, this means the connection was not established. Please check the IP and status of the server your trying to connect to. After this, you can drag any files within the GUI and it will automatically send the file to the selected server. Once done, the application will respond with how many characters was transferred to the server.
